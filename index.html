			<h3>About Me</h3>
		</div>

		<img id="myimg" src="assets/images/priggs_image.jpeg" alt="Pauletta Riggs">

		<p>I grew up on the Navajo Nation in a small town on the southwest corner of the reservation. Leupp, Arizona is located about 50 miles northeast of Flagstaff, Arizona and 30 miles northwest of Winslow, Arizona. I attended Winslow High School, living in a dormitory for four years. Then after graduating from high school, I moved to Phoenix, Arizona to attend Arizona State University.</p>

		<p>While still a student at ASU, I began working for the athletic department, specificially within their human resources office. I have worked for ASU for eighteen years. I suppose I stayed at ASU for so many years because I work with great people and have had excellent bosses. Not to mention, the perks are great, I get to attend football, basketball and baseball games for free. Working for a university also allowed me to complete my undergraduate degree in Interdisciplinary Studies (concentrations in Informatics and Business). </p>

		<p>Although I do not have children of my own, I have three, beautiful grandchildren who are my world (in my culture they are referred to as my grandchildren but you would probably refer to them as my great-nieces). The oldest is nearly 3 years old, while the two younger ones are 11 months and 9 months old.</p>

		<p>Below are some of my favorite things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pearl Jam</li>
				<li>Foo Fighters</li>
				<li>Historical fiction books</li>
				<li>Jane Austen Novels</li>
				<li>Outlander Series by Diana Gabaldon</li>
				<li>Ready Player One by Ernest Cline</li>
				<li>The Martian by Andy Weir</li>
				<li>The Help by Kathryn Stockett</li>
				<li>The Nightingale by Kristen Hannah</li>
				<li>Big Bang Theory</li>
				<li>Game of Thrones</li>
				<li>Downton Abbey and other british-themed shows</li>
			</ul>
